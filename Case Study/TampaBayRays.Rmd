## Background

After coming off of a shortened season in 2020, many players and fans are very excited for this season of baseball. After a total of 70 games played, the Tampa Bay Rays are leading the league in number of strikeouts (735). They also currently have the best win to lost record in their division with 43 wins and 27 loses. The next closest team in strikeouts are the Detroit Tigers (697). The Detroit Tigers have a total of 29 wins and 40 loses. How are the Tampa Bay Rays winning while leading the league in number of strikeouts? Is there a relationship between the number of strikeouts in a game and the number of runs scored? Is there a difference in the number of strikeouts and runs per game between wins and losses?

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Be sure to download the TampaBayRays.csv file and save it
# into your Data folder prior to knitting this file.
baseball <- read.csv("../../Data/TampaBayRays.csv", header=TRUE)
library(car)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(pander)
library(DT)

# Remember, to get the TampaBayRays data into your Console you have
# to use the "Import Dataset" option in the "Environment" window.
```

## The Data

To be able to see if there is a relationship between the number of strikeouts in a game and the number of runs scored, I collected the number of strikeouts the Tampa Bay Rays had in that game. I also collected the number of runs the Tampa Rays scored in that game. The complete data set is below:

```{r}
tampa <- baseball %>%
  select(-Game)
datatable(tampa, options=list(lengthMenu = c(10,20,40)), extensions="Responsive")
```


## Hypothesis

For this test, we will be using a multiple linear regression test. We will be testing to see if the y-intercepts will be the same and we will also be testing to see if the slopes will be equal to each other. We will be using the following formula to help run this test.
$$
  \underbrace{Y_i}_{\text{Runs}} = \overbrace{\beta_0 + \beta_1 \underbrace{X_{i1}}_{\text{Runs}}}^{\text{Loses}} + \overbrace{\beta_2 \underbrace{X_{i2}}_{\text{1 if they Won}} + \beta_3 \underbrace{X_{i1} X_{i2}}_{\text{Interaction}}}^{\text{Win Adjustments }} 
$$


### Test for Equal y-intercept

If $\beta_2$ is zero in the combined regression model above, then the y-intercepts, which represent the average number of runs scored in a game, are the same for both wins and loses. If $\beta_2$ is greater than zero, then the games that the Tampa Bay Rays won have a higher number of runs scored than they do if they lost the game, and if $\beta_2$ is less than zero, then the games that the Tampa Bay Rays lost have a higher number of runs scored than they do if they won the game. These hypotheses will be judged at the $\alpha=0.05$ significance level.

$$
  H_0: \beta_2 = 0 \quad \text{(Equal average number of runs scored in a game)} \\
  H_a: \beta_2 \neq 0 \quad \text{(Non-equal average number of runs scored in a game)}
$$

### Test for Equal slope

If $\beta_3$ is zero, then the slopes of the two lines are the same. This would imply that the number of strikeouts is the same for both wins and loses. However, if the slopes differ, i.e., $\beta_3 \neq 0$, then either win or loses have more or less strikeouts than the other. These hypotheses will be judged at the $\alpha=0.05$ significance level.

$$
  H_0: \beta_3 = 0 \quad \text{(Equal number of strikeouts)} \\
  H_a: \beta_3 \neq 0 \quad \text{(Non-equal number of strikeouts)}
$$

## Test


```{r}
baseball.lm <- lm(Runs ~ Strikeouts + W.L + Strikeouts:W.L, data = baseball)
coef <- coef(baseball.lm)

plot(Runs ~ Strikeouts, data = baseball, col=as.factor(W.L),pch=16, main = "Number of Runs per Game vs Number of Strikeouts per Game", ylab = "Number of Runs per Game" , xlab = "Number of Strikeouts per Game")
abline(a=coef[1],b=coef[2],col=2)
abline(a=coef[1]+coef[3],b=coef[2]+coef[4],col=1)
legend("topright", col=palette(), pch=21, legend=c("Loses", "Win"),  text.col = c(1,2))

```

From the scatter plot above we can see that there are two very different lines representing the data for both wins and loses. If we look at the the line representing loses, we can see it is increasing, and we can say that as the number of strikeouts per game increases the number of runs also increase. If we look at the line representing wins, we can see it is slightly decreasing, and we can also say that as the number of strikeouts per game increases the number of runs decreases. Here are all the numbers acquired from the test.

```{r}
summary(baseball.lm) %>% 
  pander()
```

Since $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$ are not significant. We will drop $\beta_2$ since it has the highest p-value of 0.6572 and run the test again. 

```{r}
baseball.lm <- lm(Runs ~ Strikeouts + Strikeouts:W.L, data = baseball)
summary(baseball.lm) %>% 
  pander()
```

## Hide Assumption

## Show Assumption
```{r, message = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(baseball.lm, which=1)
qqPlot(baseball.lm$residuals, id = FALSE)
mtext(side=3,text="Q-Q Plot of Residuals")
plot(baseball.lm$residuals, type="b")
mtext(side=3, text="Residuals vs. Order")
```
We can assume that this test will be okay to use for our analysis, because the red line in the Residual vs. Fitted plot is not very dramatic. In the Q-Q Plot, it does not show any of the dots out side of the dashed dotted line. The data points 21 and 22 seem to be outliers, but we will leave the data points in and work around this problem.

The Residuals vs Fitted checks the assumptions 1 and 3. If there is no pattern found in the Residuals vs. Fitted graph then assumptions are met. The Normal Q-Q plot, which is the middle graph, checks the second assumption. If the residuals follow the line, then the assumption was met. The Residuals vs. Order plot checks the 5th assumption. If there is no pattern found in the first glance then the assumption is met.

#

## Conclusion
As we look at the results from our test, we can conclude that their is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis for both equal y-intercept ($\text{p-value}= 0.3472$, $\alpha < \text{p-value}$) and equal slope ($\text{p-value}= 0.188$, $\alpha < \text{p-value}$). Even after we drop $beta_2$, all the p-values are still larger than the alpha.This means that we cannot conclude that there is a difference between the average number of runs scored per game if there were zero strikeouts for both wins and loses. We also cannot conclude that there is a difference between the relationship between strikeouts and runs per game when compared to wins and loses.
